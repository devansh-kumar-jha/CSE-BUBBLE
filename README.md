# CSE-BUBBLE
This repository contains the course project of CS220A. We have made an Instruction Set Architecture with 25 Instructions using the verilog hardware description language.

## FILES AND FOLDERS IN THE PROJECT
1) *problem.pdf* - Contains the explanantion of the problem statement required to be solved.
2) *source* - Folder for source code.
3) *examples* - Some examples of execution of simple programs using FSM controlled by the source code.
4) *testing* - Debugging testbenches are present in this folder.
5) *documentation.pdf* - Contains the description of the design of Instruction Set Architecture including processor architecture, instructions supported with machine conversion and memory architecture.

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR USAGE
To run any program of your choice using the FSM -
1) Go to **examples** folder and create a verilog module file.
```
cd examples
```
2) Copy the contents of file *format.v* in your file.
3) Add instructions converted to machine code in the instruction section and data in data section.
4) Run the test bench using
```
iverilog -o test program_name.v
vvp test
```
Replace the phrase program_name with the name of your verilog program file.

## INSTRUCTIONS TO CHECK EXECUTION
1)**PDS - 1** -  The details are mentioned in the documentation.
2)**PDS - 2** -  The details are mentioned in the documentation.
3)**PDS - 3** -  The details are mentioned in the documentation.
4)**PDS - 4** -  The instruction fetch phase has been implemented in "processor.v" file in source folder from lines 179 to 197.
5)**PDS - 5** -  The instruction decode phase has been implemented in "decode.v", and "processor.v" lines 200 to 262, in the source folder
6)**PDS - 6** - The ALU has been implemented in "alu.v" in the source folder.
7)**PDS - 7** - The branching operations have been implemented in "branching.v" in the source folder.
8)**PDS - 8** - Go to fsm_test folder in examples folder. *fsm_test.asm* contains the MIPS code which is used to test the functioning of the Finite State Machine of the 
```
cd examples\fsm_test
iverilog -o test fsm_test.v
vvp test
```
The line 47 is used to print the state of the fsm at each clock cycle, it can be commented if we just want to see the output.

9)**PDS - 9** - Go to bubble_sort folder in examples folder and run the program *bubble_sort.asm* on QtSpim to check the execution of MIPS assembly program. This program is converted into source machine code and is mentioned in file *bubble_sort_isa.txt*.
```
cd examples\bubble_sort
```
10)**PDS - 10** - Run the verilog programs bubble_sort_auto.v or bubble_sort.v to see the output of the buble_sort program.
```
cd examples\bubble_sort
iverilog -o test bubble_sort_auto.v
vvp test
```
This will show the output of bubble sort program. Note that you can also use *bubble_sort.v* in place of *bubble_sort_auto.v*.
If you use *bubble_sort.v* you can change the array enterred in the program by changing the data section in file *bubble_sort.v*.
