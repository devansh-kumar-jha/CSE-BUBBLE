# EXAMPLES
This folder consists of various programs which will be executed on the machine defined under source folder. The output and program counter control will be provided by the FSM itself apart from the basic system controls.

## FOLDERS AND FILES INCLUDED
1) **basic_io** - Contains .asm, .c and .v files for checking the system call instruction which include basic input/output operations and printing the values stored in an array.
2) **bubble_sort** - Contains .asm, .c and .v files for sorting the array using bubble sort, and printing the sorted array as well as initial array.
3) **fsm_test** - Contains .asm, .c and .v files for testing the working of FSM machine using a simple exit controlled loop.
4) *format.v* - This is a guiding structure which shows you the exact place and format where the machine code is to be placed for its successful upload and run on the created FSM.
